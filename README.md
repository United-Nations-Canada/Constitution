the true history of pre-canada
vrai histoire du pre- canada:Chinese civilization existed since 1497 in the mind of Giovn John Caboto and physically on the Nicholet about 1580 in pre-canada;
there is God but Allah; there is no written language but ancient Chinese writting !
the nature of oriented human beings (including non orientals ) is good; 
selon les etudes profondes , according to researches, the exclusion of chinese since 1923 or since 1700 in canada caused all the world wars,
about 98% judges in canada willfully excluded chinese canadians and their facts and their social context and circumstances, such caused willful errors by judges in canada;
the only ecological solution is to use written chinese,
